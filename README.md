# Tiny Story Blog

A blog based on data stolen from https://dummyjson.com/posts that shows different posts from users. Clicking on a post takes you to that post where you can see the comments. You can also click on the username of a post to get to that persons profile.

## Requirements
- Display the posts as a list of cards. With a clear paragraph body and title for each card. The tags should be displayed at the bottom of the card

- It should display 5 different sections. These are based on the “tags” value you get from the API. You decide yourself which 5 tags you wanna show

- The sections should be clearly separated from each other, and it should be clear which one is which

- Everything should be in React with TypeScript!
